# FindTheAlien

www.newgrounds.com was hosting a game jam, where we had to create a game with the web app called Wick Editor. Its like a web based and open sourced alternative for Adobe flash. The editor is still in its alpha version, but its working good. I faced troubles but I managed to find solutions with the help of the dev team and community forum of Wick editor. 

To check my code, use the FTA_JUL_8_save28.wick file in https://editor.wickeditor.com/
